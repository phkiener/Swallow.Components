# Open tasks

## Reactive

- Imitate `hx-sync` (queue-all especially)
- Add loading indicator/interaction stopper?
- Support debouncing
- Try out sending DOM-diffs instead of the full DOM (RenderBatch even?)
- Can we do URLs based on `{type}/{trigger}/{event}`?
  - This makes more sense with identifiers, tho
- Handle `@key` in identifiers, too?
- Asynchronous processing, we need a way to wait for these tasks

## Components

- Think about which components to include
- Think long and hard about CSS classes vs. component styles

## Utilities

- RouteGenerator: Handle route parameters -> methods instead of properties
